            <p class="content">
                Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.

        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Branch</h4>
            <p class="content">
                This command is your general-purpose branch administration tool. It lets you create isolated development environments within a single repository.
            </p> 
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Clone</h4>
            <p class="content">

            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Commit</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Init</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Initializes a new Git repository. If you want to place a project under revision control, this is the first command you need to learn.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Log</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Lets you explore the previous revisions of a project. It provides several formatting options for displaying committed snapshots.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Merge</h4>
            <p class="content">
                A powerful way to integrate changes from divergent branches. After forking the project history with git branch, git merge lets you put it back together again.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Pull</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Pulling is the automated version of git fetch. It downloads a branch from a remote repository, then immediately merges it into the current branch. This is the Git equivalent of svn update.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Push</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Pushing is the opposite of fetching (with a few caveats). It lets you move a local branch to another repository, which serves as a convenient way to publish contributions. This is like svn commit, but it sends a series of commits instead of a single changeset.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h4>Git Status</h4>
            <p class="content">
                Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see exactly what’s being included in the next snapshot.
